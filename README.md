# AfterMarket Research

This gem is meant to provide a Command-Line Interface for running simple market research queries on Craigslist.

The gem allows you to specify an area of NYC, a search query, and set parameters for minimum and maximum price (for the search). The program will run a search on Craigslist, collect the pricing data, and run some basic analyses to return the mean, median, and mode prices for your product in your area.

NOTE: This gem is for small-scale personal research purposes only. This gem is not intended for any commercial applications.
